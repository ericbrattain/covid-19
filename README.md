# covid-19

I'm a math professor at SUNY New Paltz, and our campus has switched all classes to distance learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. I plan to create a series of notebooks exploring different aspects of the crisis. 

First, there is a simple notebook updated on March 17, 2020 that compares a few different models for the growth of confirmed cases in countries with very different responses. I'll expand this and include more expository notes about the math.

Next, I've started sampling English-language tweets tagged as related to covid-19 that contain xenophobic terms, inspired by the oval office address in which the phrase "foreign virus" was used. I plan to include some results in the next couple days.
