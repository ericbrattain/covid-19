# covid-19

I'm a math professor at SUNY New Paltz, and our campus has switched all classes to distance learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. I plan to create a series of notebooks exploring different aspects of the crisis. 

First, there is a simple notebook made on March 15, 2020 that compares a few different models for the growth of confirmed cases in countries with very different responses.

Next, I've started sampling English-language tweets tagged as related to covid-19 that contain xenophobic terms, inspired by the oval office address on Friday March 13th in which the phrase "foreign virus" was used. I plan to include some results in the next couple days.
